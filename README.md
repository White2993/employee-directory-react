# employee-directory-react

By far the hardest part of this project was deploying to gh-pages. I could be in the minority, but it seems that any time a project is ready for deployment, something goes horribly, horribly wrong. And then I start to panic. And then I break things further. And then I have to get out of a hole that I dug myself into.

Either way, not too too hard. Not much to say on this one.
